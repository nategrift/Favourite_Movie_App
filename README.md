# Movie Favourite App

Orignally Created for a Shopify Internship Challenge

## Goal

We needed to create a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.
